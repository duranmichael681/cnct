# ‚õìÔ∏è CNCT ‚õìÔ∏è

![Demo Animation](assets/linkChain.gif)

**CNCT** shorter for connect is a website where FIU students can easily create and join plans ‚Äî from volleyball or running to sparring and study groups. Each plan has a messaging thread for quick coordination and a ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Going‚Äù list so everyone knows who‚Äôs in.

## Overview üìù

Our App is going to be the cornerstone of social interaction of students wanting to come together and meet like minded indivduals who want to come together and overall CNCT (see what I did there :)). This app can be used for many things as described earlier so we want to cater to as many niche social groups as possible and honestly invite new people to find new hobbys because I know all you reading this can relate to this here, we as a society try to just come to school get to class and get out and this is supposed to invert the stigma that we have has people to get out of our comfort zones and try new things, see new faces and create new experiences.
